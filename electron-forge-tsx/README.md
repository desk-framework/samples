# Electron example

> **Note:** If you're building an Electron app that uses the Desk framework, it's a good idea to follow the instructions for getting started with Electron Forge. Afterwards, copy the initialization code from the renderer source file(s) in this repository.

This project shows how to use the Desk framework from within the renderer process of an Electron application.

Refer to `src/renderer.ts`, which contains the Desk entry point for the renderer process. In this example, only a single activity is included.
